# ARM mbed OS
 
mbed OS is an open-source embedded operating system designed specifically for the "things" in the Internet of Things (IoT). It includes all the features you need to develop a connected product based on an ARM Cortex-M microcontroller.
 
mbed OS accelerates the process of creating a connected product by providing a platform operating system that includes robust security foundations, standards based communication capabilities, built-in cloud management services, and drivers for sensors, I/O devices and connectivity. mbed OS is built as a modular, configurable software stack so that you can readily customize it to the device you're developing for, and reduce memory requirements by excluding unnecessary software components.
